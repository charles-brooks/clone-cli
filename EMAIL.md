Dear Abuse Team,

I am writing on behalf of Crypto Asset Recovery (https://cryptoassetrecovery.com/) to formally notify you that a fraudulent clone of our website is being hosted on your network. The infringing domain is:

<URL_HERE>

This clone site is impersonating our brand and business, using identical text, images, and design elements from our legitimate website. It is actively engaging in phishing, brand infringement, and fraud, posing a significant risk to consumers.

We have attached a detailed Clone Similarity Report documenting:

High similarity in content (<NUM> overall, with <PERCENT> matches on key pages).

Complete reuse of our proprietary images and design assets (<PERCENT> similarity).

Structural duplication of our site.

WHOIS data confirming the domain was recently registered solely for this impersonation attempt.

As the hosting provider (<HOSTING_COMPANY>, via nameservers <NAME_SERVERS>), you are in a position to immediately disable this malicious site.

We respectfully request that you:


Suspend hosting services for <URL_HERE>.

Prevent further use of your infrastructure for phishing and brand impersonation against our company.

Crypto Asset Recovery takes these matters seriously to protect both our clients and the public from fraud. Please confirm receipt of this request and the actions you will take.

Thank you for your prompt attention.

Sincerely,
